## How to build
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Go to main folder of the application and run `flutter build web`
- This populates a `build/web` directory with built files, including an assets directory, which need to be served together.
- Use files files from `build/web` for deploying
